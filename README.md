## Installation

Once the repo has been cloned locally from github, you cna run this locally by installing the dependencies using `npm i` and then setting up the database using `mysql -u root -p` followed by `source ./db/schema.sql`. Finally typing `npm start`. This will enable the site to on on your localhost. If you wish to make this live on the web you will need to push up to a service such as Heroku, following their installation practises.
